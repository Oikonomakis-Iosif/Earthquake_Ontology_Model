EARTHQUAKE MODEL


--- CLASSES ---
	

	EQ1 Earthquake
	
		subclass of :
			E5 Event
		
		Scope Note : Earthquakes are temporal events, they are a movement of tectonic plates. As such EQ1 is a subclass of E5 Event. Earthquakes may consist of
			smaller sub-quakes. 
			
		Examples : "e7" , "Earthquake of 1365" , "Earthquake with entry number 13" 
	
		
	
	EQ2 Comparison evaluation
		subclass of :
			I5 Inference Making
			S5 Inference Making
			
		Scope Note : This is used to compare two instances of the same entity . It is similar to a mathematical comparison. However, the comparison can be done both for entities 
		that can not be measured, which means they are either equal or unequal, and for entities that can be measured.  Currently this can also be used to implement a logical XOR 
		comparison, but it is subject to change in the future.
		
		
	EQ3 Comparison Value
		subclass of 
			E59 Primitive Value
			
		Scope Note : These are the values that a comparison evaluation can have. Exclusive is subject to be removed in the future.
		
		Constraint - Allowed values are (parentheses give the mathematical interpretation, not the value given) :
			equal ( == ), unequal ( /= ), more than ( > ), less than ( < ), equal or more than ( >= ), equal or less than ( <= ), exclusive (XOR) .
	

--- PROPERTIES ---
	

		
	PEQ1 has error margin (is error margin of)
	
		Domain : E54 Dimension
		Range : E60 Number.
		
		Quantification : Many to 1.
		
		Scope note : This is used for dimensions that were measured with a physical error (i.e. 5.4 ± 0.2 cm) to express the error value. A ranged value 7-9 is different from 
			a measured value 8 ± 1 .
		

		

	PEQ2 checks equality of (of whom equality is checked in )
	
		Domain: EQ6 Comparison evaluation
		Range : E1 CRM Entity
		
		Quantification : Many to 1.
		
		Scope Note : Used for comparison evaluations, provides the left side of the comparison.
		
		Constraints: many to 1.  Requires usage of checks equality to. Both ranges must be the same class.

		
	PEQ3 checks equality to ( to whom equality is checked in )
	
		Domain: EQ6 Comparison evaluation
		Range : E1 CRM Entity
		
		Quantification : Many to 1.
		
		Scope Note : Used for comparison evaluations, provides the right side of the comparison.
		
		Constraints: many to 1.  Requires usage of checks equality of. Both ranges must be the same class.
		
	PEQ4 has comparison value (is comparison value of)
	
		Domain : EQ6 Comparison evaluation
		Range : EQ7 Comparison Value
		
		Quantification : Many to 1.
		
		Scope Note : Used to provide the result/value of a comparison.


	PEQ5 has documented possible timespan ( is possible timespan documented in )
	
		subproperty of : "P4 has time-span"
	
		Domain : EQ1 Earthquake
		Range : E52 Time-Span
		
		Quantification : Many to Many.
		
		Scope Note : This is a shortcut to an uncertain timespan.


	PEQ6 has documented possible place ( is possible place documented in )
	
		subproperty of : "P7 took place at"
	
		Domain : EQ1 Earthquake
		Range : E53 Place
		
		Quantification : Many to Many.
	
		Scope Note : This is a shortcut to an uncertain place.
	
	PEQ7 has documented possible epicenter place ( is possible epicenter place documented in )
	
		subproperty of : "P7 took place at"
	
		Domain : EQ1 Earthquake
		Range : E53 Place
		
		Quantification : Many to Many.
		
		Scope Note : This is a shortcut to an uncertain epicenter place.
	
	PEQ8 has documented possible dimension ( is possible dimension documented in )
	
		subproperty of : "O12 has dimension"
	
		Domain : EQ1 Earthquake
		Range : E54 Place
		
		Quantification : Many to Many.
		
		Scope Note : This is a shortcut to an uncertain dimension.
		
	PEQ9 has documented uncertainty factor  ( is uncertainty factor documented in )
	
		Domain : E54 Dimentsion
		Range : I6 Belief Value
		
		Quantification : Many to Many.
		
		Scope Note : This is a shortcut to a referred uncertainty factor.
